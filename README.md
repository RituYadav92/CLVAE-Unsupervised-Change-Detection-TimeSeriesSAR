## Abstract 
Human civilization has an increasingly powerfulinfluence on the earth system. Affected by climate change andland-use change, natural disasters such as flooding have beenincreasing in recent years. Earth observations are an invaluablesource for assessing and mitigating negative impacts. Detectingchanges from Earth observation data is one way to monitor thepossible impact. Effective and reliable Change Detection (CD)methods can help in identifying the risk of disaster events atan early stage. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervisedCD method on time series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)data. Our proposed method is a probabilistic model trained withunsupervised learning techniques, reconstruction, and contrastivelearning. The change map is generated with the help of thedistribution difference between pre-incident and post-incidentdata. Our proposed CD model is evaluated for flood detectiontask. We verified the efficacy of our model on 8 differentflood sites, including three recent flood events from CopernicusEmergency Management Services and six from the Sen1Floods11dataset. Our proposed model achieved an average of 64.53%Intersection Over Union(IoU) value and 75.43% F1 score. Ourachieved IoU score is approximately 6-27% and F1 score isapproximately 7-22% better than the compared unsupervisedand supervised existing CD methods. Based on our CD method,we also proposed an automatic change point detection frameworkwhere time series data is processed through the model to identifypercentage change and the date on which significant changestarted to reflect on SAR data. This can help in early detectionof floods giving more time for response. Our proposed modeland change point detection framework are lightweight and easyto deploy. We conducted a range of experiments and ablation onour model. The results and extensive discussion presented in thestudy show the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised CD method.
